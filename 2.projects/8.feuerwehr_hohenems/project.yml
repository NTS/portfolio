The Videoinstallation Firehouse Hohenems refers to the current sitate of the interiors, in which nothing reminds of the original utilization of the Building as a former Synagoge. The surface of the interiors is thrown back upon. This visual doubling make the walls become alive. They seem to become transparent for a glance on the comitted destruction, at the same time refusing new images and answers. With her work, the artist tries to transform the emptiness, that which is missig and cannot be reconstructed into an image of ist own, to offer a reflection surface to the viewer.
